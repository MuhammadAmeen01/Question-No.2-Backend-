## Recursive Function
## Advantages:
They are simple and easy to implement.
They can be used to model other recursive processes.

### Disadvantages:
It can be slow for large values of n due to the high time complexity.
It can cause a large stack space usage.
Inefficient since it recomputes the same values repeatedly.

## Iterative Function
### Advantages:
They are faster than the recursive function due to the lower time complexity.
We can create variables to store current and previous computed values
### Disadvantages:
More complex to implement than the recursive function.

## Memoization
### Advantages:
They are Fast since it avoids redundant computations and only computes each value once.
### Disadvantages:
Uses more memory than the iterative function since it stores all values in the memoization table.

## Running Enviroment
Before running the code you should have installed gcc compiler in your pc. 
You can use the following link: https://dev.to/gamegods3/how-to-install-gcc-in-windows-10-the-easier-way-422j
You can use the following gcc command to run the code:
```
gcc -g Q2.c
```
An a.exe file will be generated to run the exe you can run the following command:
```
./a
```
